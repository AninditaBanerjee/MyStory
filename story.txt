Karan and Subhash were two friends who loved adventure. They would get themselves into all sorts of trouble due to their love for taking risks. Once they went on a school trip to another city where they were visiting an old fort.  While exploring the fort the two sneaked away from their group and were trying to scale a dilapidated wall of the fort when they were spotted by Chhotey Lal, one of the security team members of the fort.
