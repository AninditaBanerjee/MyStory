Karan and Subhash were two friends who loved adventure. They would get themselves into all sorts of trouble due to their love for taking risks. Once they went on a school trip to another city where they were visiting an old fort.  

While exploring the fort the two sneaked away from their group and scaled a dilapidated wall of the fort and found themselves in the forest reserve behind the fort.
